#  Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project provides a web-based tool to detect plant diseases from leaf images using a deep learning model (ResNet50). It is trained on a labeled dataset of plant leaves and deployed using **Streamlit** for a clean and simple user interface.

##  Features

- Upload a plant leaf image and detect the disease class
- Uses a fine-tuned **ResNet50** model trained on image data
- Deployed with **Streamlit** for interactive use
- Simple and effective UI for users without technical background
